# Contributing to Claude Code Art Gallery

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Claude Code Art Gallery! We love seeing creative ASCII art from the community.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Create Your ASCII Art

Create your ASCII artwork in a `.txt` file. Here are some guidelines:

- **Dimensions**: Keep it reasonable (typically 60-80 characters wide, 15-25 lines tall)
- **Characters**: Use standard ASCII characters that display well in terminals
- **Theme**: Claude Code, programming, AI, or creative tech themes work great!
- **Creativity**: Be creative! Minimalist, retro, neon, cosmic - all styles welcome

### 2. Test Your Artwork

Before submitting, test your artwork:

```bash
# Preview in terminal
cat your-artwork.txt

# Test with Claude Code (optional)
./install.sh your-artwork
```

### 3. Submit Your Artwork

**Option A: Pull Request (Recommended)**

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your artwork file to `artwork/community-submissions/your-name-theme.txt`

4. Create a pull request with:
   - Clear title: "Add [Your Theme] artwork"
